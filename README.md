# Ergonomics-Visual-Studio

- The Ergonomics-Visual-Studio repository contains an application developed with .net in visual studio, which is used to apply the parameters of the official Mexican standard 36.
- The official Mexican standard 36 establishes the ergonomic requirements for the manual handling of loads, in order to prevent musculoskeletal injuries in workers.
- The application allows you to enter the load data for the NIOSH method, the worker and the work environment, and calculate the recommended lift rate (ILR), which indicates the level of risk associated with the task.
- The data sheet obtained can be saved as an Excel, pdf or image file, in the location desired by the user.
- The repository includes the program files, the Excel files with the input and output data, the supporting images and the sample results.
- To run the application, you need to have Visual Studio installed and .net Framework 4.7.2 or higher.
